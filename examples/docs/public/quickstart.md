# Quickstart

## Install bun

**Remedy** requires a [bun](https://bun.sh), so make sure that's installed first.

## Create a project

Creating a new project is easy.

```sh
bunx @niarada/remedy new your-project-name
```

This will give you a `project.json`, and `remedy.config.ts`, and install the remedy base module.  That's it.

Edit your config file, or not, then follow the instructions to run the server.

Drop files into your configured public folder, and you're off to the races.

This base [configuration](/configuration) includes support for html [templates](/templates).
