# Introduction

**remedy** is a *Hypermedia Server* hosted on the [bun](https://bun.sh) runtime with [htmx](https://htmx.org) as a first-class integration.

## Get started

Find a cozy spot and run:

```
bunx @niarada/remedy
```

A `public` folder will be created for you, and anything in it will be served by **remedy**.
